**`Aspiring Tech Enthusiast (Software Developer / Programmer / Editor)`**

With extensive experience in full-stack development, I excel in both frontend and backend technologies. I have worked with a variety of frameworks and tools including NetBeans, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse for both frontend and backend development, and MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Apache Derby for database systems. When working on my code, I start by thoroughly understanding the problem at hand, breaking it down into manageable parts. I frequently test and debug each section to ensure it functions correctly before moving on. If I encounter challenges, I research solutions or seek advice to overcome them efficiently. Throughout the process, I prioritize writing maintainable code that can be easily understood and modified in the future whilst also gaining more knowledge and insight to be used in future endeavors.

  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Franz's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>I began my coding journey as an eager computer science student, driven by a passion to learn everything I could about the programming world starting from the basics. While teaching myself Java and Python with dreams of creating my own app, my focus soon shifted to mastering database systems alongside them. My aim is to become proficient as a full-stack developer and database analyst and to land a good software engineering job after graduation. Alongside my career aspirations, I’ve also been passionate about other things, like playing games and YouTube content creation/editing. Eventually, I made the decision to lessen the time I spent on these other passions to focus more on my career.

There’s always been a part of me that regretted not starting earlier to learn the fundamentals and basics back in my early high school days, and I feared that I would get left behind. However, I decided to focus on learning instead of comparing myself to others, and now I’ve made significant progress compared to when I first started. Many challenging projects and tasks have been assigned to us in college, especially during the first and second years, but gradually, these projects are what truly taught us valuable skills and insights. I’m grateful for that because challenging oneself is the only way to improve and gain more knowledge and insight on certain topics. That’s one of the many reasons why I love taking on challenges!

To achieve my goal, I’ll be doing my best to learn more about the skills I need to become a great software developer and data analyst so I can land a job I’m passionate about. It’s a goal I plan to fully pursue, with the groundwork being laid throughout the rest of my time pursuing my college degree. So, stay tuned—I’m on a mission, and I’m not slowing down.</p>
